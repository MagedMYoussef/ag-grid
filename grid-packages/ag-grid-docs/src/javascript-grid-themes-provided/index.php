    <h1>Provided Themes</h1>

    <p class="lead">
        The grid comes with a few provided themes, and the quickest way to get a nice style onto a grid is to apply one of them.
    </p>

    <p>
        The themes can be used without any modification, or can be <a href="#customising-themes">customised</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Themes Summary</h2>

                    Balham was the recommended theme before Alpine was developed. It is still a great choice
                    for applications that need to fit more data onto each page.

                    <span class="reccommendation">Recommendation:</span>
                    This theme looks great for simple applications with lots of white space, and is the obvious
                    choice if the rest of your application follows the Google Material Design spec. However the
                    Material spec doesn't cater for advanced grid features such as grouped columns and tool panels.
                    If your application uses these features, consider using <code>ag-theme-alpine</code> instead.
                </p>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        To use a theme add the theme class name to the <code>div</code> element that contains your grid. The following is an example of using the balham theme:
    </p>

    <snippet language="html">
        &lt;div id="myGrid" class="ag-theme-balham"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    </snippet>

    <p>You need to ensure that the CSS for your theme is loaded.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Some pre-built bundles, whether <a href="/javascript-grid-download/">downloaded from our website</a> or included in the <code>ag-grid-community</code> <a href="/javascript-grid-npm/">NPM package</a>, already embed the styles. If you are using one of these files you do not need to separately load CSS.</li>
        <li>If you're not using a JS bundle with styles embedded, you need to include the theme's styles in the HTML page with a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag. There are a few ways to do this:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If you are using a JavaScript bundler like webpack or Rollup and it is configured to load styles, you can <code>require()</code> the correct CSS file from node_modules. This is the recommended approach as webpack will take care of minifying your CSS in production.</li>
            <li>You can copy (manually or as part of your app's build) a CSS file from node_modules and serve it with your app.</li>
            <li>You can load the theme from a free CDN by adding this code to your page <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@ag-grid-community/all-modules@23.0.0/dist/styles/ag-theme-balham.css"&gt;</code>, making sure that the CSS version matches the JS version you're using. (Note: this is useful for testing but not recommended for production as your app will be unavailable if the unpkg servers are down)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Note that the Material theme requires the Roboto font, and this is not bundled in the material CSS. The easiest way to load Roboto is through Google's CDN:
    </p>

    <snippet language="html">
        &lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
        &lt;div id="myGrid" class="ag-theme-material"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    </snippet>

    <h1 id="customising-themes">Customising themes</h1>

    <p>
        In order to customise a theme, you need to set up your project to compile Sass files. The recommended way to process your project's Scss
        files is through webpack, since it provides various loaders that optimize and reduce the final size of the bundle. We provide a
        <a href="https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid-customise-theme/tree/master/src/vanilla">general webpack example</a> appropriate Vanilla JS and React
        projects, and an <a href="https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid-customise-theme/tree/master/src/angular">angular example</a> using Angular CLI.
    </p>

    <p>
        To customise a theme, include the theme mixin file and then call the mixin passing parameters to customise it. Then add CSS rules for advanced customisation:
    </p>

    <snippet language="scss">
@import "~ag-grid-community/src/styles/ag-theme-alpine/sass/ag-theme-alpine-mixin";

.ag-theme-alpine {
    @include ag-theme-alpine((
        // use theme parameters where possible
        alpine-active-color: deeppink
    ));

    .ag-header {
        // or write CSS selectors to make customisations beyond what the parameters support
        text-shadow: deeppink;
    }
}
    </snippet>

    <h2>Important theme parameters</h2>

    <p>There is a full list of theme parameters below, but a few important ones are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>grid-size</code> is the main control for affecting how tightly data and UI elements are packed together.
            All padding and spacing in the grid is defined as a multiple of grid-size,
            so increasing it will make most components larger by increasing their internal white
            space while leaving the size of text and icons unchanged.</li>
        <li><code>borders</code> controls whether borders are drawn around the grid. There are more <code>border-*</code> variables to provide fine-grained control over which borders are drawn and their color.</li>
        <li><code>row-height</code> height in pixels of a grid row.</li>
        <li><code>header-height</code> height in pixels of a header row.</li>
        <li>The provided themes have theme-specific variables to set the color of many elements at once. These are shortcuts for setting several other variables.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><code>alpine-active-color</code> (Alpine only) sets the colour of checked checkboxes, range selections, row selections, selected tab underlines, and input focus outlines</li>
            <li><code>balham-active-color</code> (Balham only) sets the colour of checked checkboxes, range selections, row selections, and input focus outlines</li>
            <li><code>material-primary-color</code> and <code>material-accent-color</code> (Material only) set the colours used for the primary and accent colour roles specified in the <a href="https://material.io/design/color/">Material Design color system</a>. Currently primary color is used for buttons, range selections, selected tab underlines and input focus underlines, and accent color is used for checked checkboxes.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Customising row and header heights</h2>
    
    <p>
        The grid uses <a href="/javascript-grid-dom-virtualisation/">DOM virtualisation</a> for rendering large amounts of data,
        which means that it needs to know the size of various elements like columns and grid rows in order to calculate their
        layout. The grid uses several strategies to work out the right size:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Firstly, the grid will attempt to measure the size of an element. This works when styles have loaded, but will not work if the grid initialises before the theme loads. Our <a href="https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid-customise-theme/blob/master/src/vanilla/grid.js">theme customisation examples</a> demonstrate how to wait for CSS to load before initialising the grid (see the cssHasLoaded function).</li>
            <li>If CSS has not loaded and one of the provided themes is in use, the grid contains hard-coded fallback values for these themes. For this reason we recommend that if you are extending a provided theme like ag-theme-alpine and have not changed the heights of elements, you do not change the theme name so that the grid knows what fallback sizes to apply.</li>
            <li>If neither of the above methods will work for your app (you do not want to delay app initialisation until after CSS has loaded, and are not using a provided theme with heights unchanged) then you should inform the grid about your custom element heights using <a href="/javascript-grid-properties/">grid properties</a>. The minimal set of properties you need to set to ensure correct functioning are: <code>rowHeight</code>, <code>headerHeight</code> and <code>minColWidth</code>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="base-theme-parameters">Full list of theme parameters</h2>
        
        <p>Here is a list of parameters accepted by the base theme and all themes that extend it, including our provided themes Balham, Alpine and Material. The default values demonstrate the kind of value that is expected (a colour, pixel value, percentage value etc) but if you are using a provided theme then the theme will have changed most of the default values. Note that some values are defined relative to other values using the internal <code>ag-derived</code> helper, so <code>data-color: ag-derived(foreground-color)</code> means that if you don't explicitly set the <code>data-color</code> property it will default to the value of <code>foreground-color</code>.</p>
